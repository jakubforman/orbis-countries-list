## Lessons Learned

The project illustrates how to create a simple application using modern tools, APIs, design patterns and frameworks.

The application is developed primarily for `Android` and `iOS` mobile devices, so tools are used to give high school students a better idea of how to develop for these platforms. However, students are also explained how to get the app onto desktop `Windows`, `MacOS` and `Linux` platforms.
